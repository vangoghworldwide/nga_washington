[1] The painting is no. 169 in the Andries Bonger list of 1890, described as ""Jeune fille à la fleur, toile de 25"" (""Catalogue des oeuvres de Vincent van Gogh,"" manuscript b 3055 V/1962, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam; copy in NGA curatorial files).

[2] The painting sold for 3000 guilders, per Jan Frederik Heijbroek and E.L. Wouthuysen, _Kunst, kennis en commercie: de kunsthandelaar J.H. de Bois (1878-1946)_,  Amsterdam, 1993:195, and Christ Stolwijk and Han Veenenbos, _The account book of Theo van Gogh and Jo van Gogh-Bonger_,  Amsterdam and Leiden, 2002: 52 (17/12), 127 (92/10), 149, 172. See also Walter Feilchenfeldt, _Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cassirer, Berlin: The Reception of van Gogh in Germany from 1901-1914_, Zwolle, 1988: 94. A label from the ""Kunsthandel C.M. van Gogh, Keizersgracht 953, Amsterdam"" is on the back of the painting. 

[3] Thea Sternheim, _Tagebücher 1905-1927. Die Jahre mit Carl Sternhaim_, Mainz, 1995: 25, mentions Carl trading the portrait to Bernheim-Jeune in exchange for a landscape. Bernheim-Jeune & Cie no. 16771 is per a label on the back of the painting. Hessel, Rosenberg and Georges Bernheim are per Chester Dale papers, in NGA curatorial files.
 
[4] The painting was lent by Kann to the 1917 exhibition _Französische Kunst des XIX. u. XX. Jahrhunderts_, Zürchner Kunsthaus, no.108, as _Fillette d'Arles_. There is also a partial label on the back of the painting that reads ""Alph. Kann. van Gogh, Fillette d'Arles.""

[5] The Stang collection was visited in January 1929 by Cesar de Hauke and Germain Seligmann, per the Seligmann papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington: Box 208. The collection was described, and this painting reproduced, by Paul Jamot in ""L'Art français en Norvège,"" _La Renaissance_ (February 1929). This painting, however, was already sold by Dr. Alfred Gold to Reid & Lefèvre by that time. See Reid & Lefèvre, Paintings Sold, sheet no. 161, #312/28 B1343, which records the date of purchase from Gold as 3 January 1928 (Lefèvre archives, Hyman Kreitman Research Centre, Tate Britain, London, TGA 2002/11, Box 283). Gold was selling pictures from the Stang collection over a number of years; see the Seligmann papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington: Box 394. Copies of all the archival documents are in NGA curatorial files.

[6] The invoice dated 5 April 1929 from Bignou to Reid & Lefèvre for the re-framing of the painting suggests it was in Paris by that time (Lefèvre archives, Hyman Kreitman Research Centre, Tate Britain, London, TGA 2002/11, Box 180). On 29 May 1929, Bignou writes that he has shipped the picture to London (Lefèvre archives, Hyman Kreitman Research Centre, Tate Britain, London, TGA 2002/11, Box 218). Copies of the 1929 invoice and letter are in NGA curatorial files.

[1]  Listed no. 255 in the Andries Bonger stock list of 1890 as ‘Jeune fille en blanc’ (12). This is a reference to a size 12 figure canvas which measured 61 x 50 cm. The painting is now considered to have been painted on a size 15 marine canvas, which measured 65 x 45 cm., Van Gogh, for his own artistic reasons, wanting to exploit the less orthodox, more elongated shape. This slight discrepancy in the canvas size is understandable given that Bonger’s assessments were presumably being made by eye alone.

[3] The Swiss dealer Max Bollag sold privately and then held a public auction of the Kisling collection on 18 November 1929. This painting was not included in the 1929 sale and remained with Bollag until its acquisition by Dale in 1951.

Bernheim-Jeune,"" _L'Art Moderne et quelques aspects de l'art d'autrefois_, vol. 1, 1919, pl. 65. Details about Gaston Bernheim de Villers' ownership and his sale of the painting to Molyneux are in a letter of 22 June 1977, from Jean Dauberville at Bernheim-Jeune & Cie. to David Rust, in NGA curatorial files. Although the painting was included in an exhibition at Reid and Lefevre in 1934, and a photograph album in their records includes the painting (with the names ""M. Ackermann, Paris"" and ""Bernheim-Jeune, Paris"" under provenance), it is not certain Reid and Lefevre actually owned it. More likely is the possibility that Molyneux purchased the painting from Bernheim de Villers out of the 1934 exhibition, with the sale handled by Bernheim-Jeune Gallery and/or Reid and Lefevre. (Martin Bailey has kindly shared his research on this part of the provenance; see his letter of 22 August 2003, in NGA curatorial files.) The sequence of ownership after Mme van Gogh-Bonger that is given by J.-B. de la Faille in _The Works of Vincent van Gogh, His Paintings and Drawings_, Amsterdam, 1970: no. F565, i.e., Bernheim-Jeune, Reid and Lefevre, Ackermann, Molyneux, is apparently in error.

[1] It seems likely that The Flower Beds in Holland was among the works that the artist abandoned in Nuenen when he made his precipitate departure for Antwerp in late 1885. These works were moved to Breda in 1886, when Van Gogh’s mother and sister Willemina moved to the town, and put in storage with a Breda carpenter, Adrianus Schrauwen. In 1902, although not their legal owner, Schrauwen sold a number of works to the brothers Couvreur, dealers in old furniture in Breda, who swiftly passed them to Kees Mouwen, a military clothing dealer, who seems to have jointly owned them with Willem van Bakel. From that source they were entrusted to the owner of the Oldenzeel gallery, Margareta Wilhelmina Oldenzeel-Schot, who exhibited them in 1904.

[2] John James Enthoven was the son of van Gogh collector Lodewijk Cornelis Enthoven [1854-1920], but this painting was actually owned first by Jan Smit, Lodewijk's father-in-law and John's grandfather, from whose sale it was acquired by John Enthoven (annotated copy of sales catalogue in NGA curatorial files). On the Enthovens and van Gogh, see _Lodewijk Cornelis Enthoven, Verzamelaar te Voorburg_, exh. cat., Museum Museum Swaensteyn, Voorburg, 2004, and Jos ten Berge, ""The Enthoven mystery,"" in _The paintings of Vincent van Gogh in the collection of the Kröller-Müller Museum_, Otterlo, 2003: 424-427 (copies NGA curatorial files). 

[3]  According to a 1954 letter from Brinkman to de la Faille, in the documentation files of the van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, the painting was with Brinkman at that time.

[1] The painting is listed in the Andries Bonger list, no 264, as ""roses dans un pot (fond vert bleu) / vendu le 9 juin 1891 à M. Gallimard à fr. 400."" This list of 364 works by Van Gogh is in the handwriting of Andries Bonger, who was Theo Van Gogh's brother-in-law. The list is undated, but thought by scholars to be c. 1890/1891 (""Catalogue des oeuvres de Vincent van Gogh,"" manuscript b 3055 V/1962, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam; transcribed and published in Walter Feilchenfeldt, _Vincent van Gogh: die Gemalde 1886-1890_, Wadenswil, 2009, and Walter Feilchenfeldt, _Vincent van Gogh, the Years in France. Complete Paintings 1886-1890_, London, 2013: 287ff; copy in NGA curatorial files). The transcription of the entry for 264 in Feilchenfeldt 2013 is missing the word ""bleu"" in the first line; see the Bonger list in digitized form at http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/en/geheugen/view?coll=ngvn&identifier=VGM01%3Ab3055 (accessed May 2018). Previously the first documented reference to Gallimard's ownership was a 1905 exhibition catalogue mentioned by J.-B. de la Faille, _The Works of Vincent van Gogh: Paintings and Drawings_, Amsterdam, 1970: no. F681. The painting is not described in Louis Vauxcelles, ""Collection M.P. Gallimard,"" _Les Arts_ (September 1908): 1-32.

[2] The painting was lent by ""Coll. B.J"" to a 1917 exhibition in Zurich, the catalogue not specifying Alexandre Bernheim (1839-1915), or his sons, Josse Bernheim-Jeune (1870-1941) or Gaston Bernheim-Jeune (1870-1953), who joined him in the art dealership.

The painting was exhibited at Alex Reid & Lefevre in Glasgow in 1929 as ""from a great private collection.""

[1] According to J.-B. de la Faille, _The Works of Vincent van Gogh: His Paintings and Drawings_, rev. ed., Amsterdam, 1970: F626, the painting was lent by Nolthenius to a 1904 exhibition in Rotterdam. Thea Sternheim, wife of the German playwright Carl Sternheim, writes in her diary that they saw the portrait on exhibition in Rotterdam in 1910, lent by Tutein Nolthenius. Nolthenius' collection was dispersed by his heirs following his death in 1944. An appraisal of the collection dated February 1944 included the Self Portrait with the annotation ""sold"" (copy, documentation center, van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam)

[2] Knoedler had the painting on consignment from the Katz Gallery when it was sold to Whitney in April 1947 (see Commission Book #4, M. Knoedler & Co Records, Getty Research Institute, copy NGA curatorial files). Katz is probably the ""private collection"" which lent the painting to a 1945 exhibition at the Galerie Schulthess, Basel and a 1946 exhibition at the Kunsthalle Bern.

[1] Bernard understood from his mother that it sold with two other works for a total of 700 francs; according to the Vollard register it sold for 150 francs 

[2] This is likely one of the van Goghs Hoogendijk bought from Vollard in May and July, 1899 (Vollard account books, July 1894- May 1900, John Rewald Papers, Box 54-2, Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, copy NGA curatorial files). Hoogendijk lent the painting to the Rijksmuseum from 1906 to 1911, along with other paintings from his collection. The painting was not included in the posthumous Hoogendijk sale held at Frederik Muller, Amsterdam, 21-22 May 1912. For details about Hoogendijk's collection, see Herbert Henkels, ""Cézanne en Van Gogh in het Rijksmuseum voor Moderne Kunst in Amsterdam: de collectie van Cornelis Hoogendijk (1866-1911),"" _Bulletin van het Rijksmuseum_ 41, no. 3/4 (1993): 155-287.

[3] He lent the painting to a 1947 exhibition shown in London, Birmingham, and Glasgow. It was briefly in the hands of Van Wisselingh in 1948, according to a newspaper clipping,  Jan Engelman, _De Tijd_, 3 July 1948.  ‘Vincent van Gogh en de Hagenaars, Een stilleven bij Van Wisselingh.’ The article is misleading for Van Wisselingh merely acted as middleman at the time of the exhibition in the Stedelijk, after which the painting returned to its owner, Tom van Blaaderen.  

[4] The year of ownership is given in the documentation on a reproduction of the painting held by The Frick Art Reference Library, New York (call number Gogh, Vincent van 316-2f).

[6] According to James Feron, ""Korda Collection Brings $1,300,000,"" _The New York Times_ (15 June 1962): 24, the painting was purchased by Willis, who attended the auction and ""said he was buying the work for a client."" The sale as a whole made 4.5 million florins and the still life fetched f. 800,00o (approximately $231,000) according to Dutch newspaper reports _Krantenknipseldienst_ the following day.  Mr. Mellon owned the painting by at least 1966, when it was exhibited at the NGA with works from his own and his sister's collections.",,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/b74be188-7a6a-4fc8-866e-55c4e11937c9,https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.164923.html,https://id.nga.gov/
